# Super-Peach-Sisters

The goal of this game is for you, Peach, to save Mario by reaching him. The game has 3 levels and you pass each level by either reaching the flag or Mario. You control Peach with WASD keys or the Arrow keys and the space bar will be used to fire Fireballs when peach has the shoot powerup. In addtion to the shoot powerup (fire flower), this game also includes mushroom powerup (higher jump and extra life) as well as star powerup (invinsibility for a limited amount of time).

The game is built for MacOS using XQuartz to help with the display
